# SEO Optimization Platform - Development Todo List

## Overview
Building an SEO optimization SaaS platform with 8 core tools, using FastAPI + React + Supabase + Crawl4AI.

## Notes & Decisions Log

- **Why FastAPI over Django**: Async support, better for AI/scraping workloads
- **Why Supabase**: Built-in pgvector for future RAG, great developer experience
- **Why delay payments**: Need product-market fit validation first
- **Why React over Next.js**: Simpler deployment, already in Archon
- **Why Crawl4AI**: Best-in-class scraping, handles JS sites well
