# overview this project 
this project will  help  me build a system that will greatly enhance the users workflow when  it comes to SEO tasks 
I want to be able to sccrape any site and store the data in a central data base 
the rag agent will be primarily for taking data from a page and then using that data as the base for recreating pages ready for the new build 
we can then add all of this extra functionality 


originally i wanted this to be a tool to migrate websites but then saw that actuyally  by settng up this process i ccould offer seo services 
now I want something that allows me to do the following 
eiter scrape  all the content from a website into a databse from either a sitemap or from a list of urls 
these are then stored inn a database 
this data can then be used to update the content 

not all tools need to use the data base some can just cretate the content and then stor it in ther databse

these tools are 
Bulk Meta Updater
Service Page Writer
Location Page Writer
Product Page Writer
Product Page Rewriter
Category Page Rewriter
Content Writer
Blog Page Updater

I also want the option to not use the database and just use the csv in and cvs out method 

I want this system to build in the following way using these phases structure below 

## Phase 1 - Building out the core SEO modules and scraping functionality
We will need to focus on:
- (03 development planning) 
- (07 workflows) - Converting n8n workflows to code
- (04 Feature specs)
### Important files to consider:
docs\04-features-specs\CORE-FUNCTIONS-SPECIFICATION.md
docs\04-features-specs\CSS-EXTRACTION-PAGE-TYPE-DETECTION.md
docs\04-features-specs\scraper dashboard.md
docs\07-workflows\n8n\ (all workflow files for conversion)

## Phase 2 - Business infrastructure and production readiness
This section we will build out the requirements that make it production ready for commercial use, this will focus on:
- Login system (Clerk integration)
- Payment gateway (Polar.sh)
- Multi-user scalability
- (05 business strategy)
### Important files to consider:
docs\05-business-strategy\HYBRID-PRICING-MODEL.md

## Phase 3 - Testing and advanced SEO features
I will be using the app to see what is working and what is not
- Adding advanced SEO features
- Competitor analysis
- SERP tracking
- Bulk operations

## Phase 4 - RAG and AI enhancement (future enhancement)
We will add the RAG system once the tool is generating revenue:
- (01 Product vision)
- (02 Technical architecture)
- (06 research)
### Important files to consider (for future):
docs\01-product-vision\MASTER-PRD-RAG-CONTENT-MIGRATION.md
docs\01-product-vision\MASTER-PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS-DOCUMENT.md
docs\02-technical-architecture\RAG-SYSTEM-DOCUMENTATION.md
docs\02-technical-architecture\FILE-STRUCTURE-SCALABILITY.md
